# <u>Final Project: Student Loan Dataset</u>
## Paulina Mostek
## Objectives:
1. Explore the National Student Loan Data System dataset using Python, and perform data cleaning using pandas. Identify questions for data analysis.
2. Perform data cleaning using pandas on the National Student Loan Data System dataset using Python.
3. Perform data analysis on the National Student Loan Data System dataset using Python, answering questions for data analysis via plotting.
Datasets: FL_Dashboard_AY2009_2010_Q1.xls and 1617FedSchoolCodeList.xlsxEXCEL from
https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/national-student-loan-data-system-722b0 

## <u>Data Questions:</u>
1. Do community colleges or technical colleges originate more loans overall?
2. Which states have the highest total loan disbursements?
3. Do private or public schools disburse more in federal student loans?
4. Do institutions with “college” in the name receive more loans than those with “university”?
5. Are unsubsidized loans more common at private colleges than public ones?
